# Meeting 15 - 12 Feb 2021

The meeting started with a discussion about the current stage of my evaluation. So far, 33 people have completed it and Jeremy thinks that we probably don't need to get 50 to complete it. We agreed that I should finish the evaluation by Wednesday 17 February. Following this, I can collate the data and start to analyse it. I should start thinking about the type of visualisations that I want to show in my dissertation. Since I have collected a lot of data, Jeremy said that calculating averages and standard deviations would be highly beneficial. Jeremy also suggested analysing the data and seeing if any correlations can be made between users. For example, people who thought the system was easy to use, spent the most time using the software. Trend analysis could then be used on these data points. For the open-ended questions, I could manually analyse these but putting each response into a "bucket". I could also carry out sentiment analysis on the open-ended questions to gauge if feedback was generally positive or negative.

Next, we discussed the requirements chapter which I sent Jeremy earlier this week. He gave me some feedback which included:

- Make the MoSCoW acronyms shorter (M, S, C, W)
- Report percentages to the nearest whole number
- State the number of people who completed the survey
- Emphasise it was just a preliminary survey, wanted users to answer questions but not looking for a large amount of data
- Emphasise that I started with a few different strategies for requirement gathering, survey and user stories, which lead to deeper requirement analysis
- Non-functional requirements need to be more specific
  - State the response time (every request must respond in 0.5 seconds, point to research paper which say the users will click away after 2 seconds etc)
  - All web browsers - state browsers in brackets
  - https://crossbrowsertesting.com/, https://www.browserstack.com/
  - State number of daily users (e.g. 100 concurrent users)
  - 30,000 should be able to login to the platform (https://www.gla.ac.uk/explore/facts/studentnumbers/ & https://www.gla.ac.uk/explore/facts/staffnumbers/)

After talking about the requirements chapter, we discussed which chapter I am going to complete next. We agreed that I should look at chapter 2. Jeremy gave me some pointers for this chapter:

- 2 sections - literature review & other software solutions
- Literature review is the different ways of doing recommendations e.g. recommender systems, textual analysis, algorithms
- Other software solutions include Samoa Events and EventBrite
- Compare software systems
- Twitter analysis - how many times does SoCS advertise seminars
- Start quite general then home in on the actual problem - seminar recommendation in an academic setting
- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/articles/personalized-recommendation-systems/

Finally, Jeremy mentioned that in the future work section I should discuss how the system could be retargeted for other academic settings. The application is closely coupled to business systems, would have to retarget the single sign-on and the scraping feeds. Essentially white labelling the software.

There will be no meeting next week due to the reading week. Our next meet will be in 2 weeks.
