# Meeting 7 - 13 Nov 2020

The meeting began with me showing Jeremy the changes which I made to the system this week. Jeremy liked the idea of introducing a dashboard to the system. He thought that it is important the dashboard is interactive and fun so people don't become bored of it.

Following this, we revisited my initial list of functional and non-functional requirements and reviewed them. We agrred that I should start looking into using EventBrite as a data stream along with Samoa. I should be able to scrape the events using web scraping or potentially using the EventBrite API. Jeremy sent over some useful EventBrite links for me to have a look at:

- https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/guest-live-lounge-countdown-to-cop-tickets-127876874173
- https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/policy-scotland-at-the-university-of-glasgow-10834796360
- https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/glasgow-local-group-of-the-royal-statistical-society-5991526139

These links could be put into a configuration file so that the system knows where to scrape events from.

After looking at EventBrite, we dicussed how we would integrate the user's calendar into the system. At first glance, this seems to not be that straight forward. I will conduct research into this and report back next week with my findings.

Finally, we agreed that an initial user evaluation should be carried out soon so that I can get feedback on the system so far. Jeremy has a pool of postgraduate students that would be able to help me out with this. Jeremy suggested that I start preparation for this. He thought that a think aloud evaluation would be reasonable for it.
