# Meeting 9 - 27 Nov 2020

The meeting commenced with me explaining to Jeremy that I had, unfortunately, not completed much work this week. This was due to lots of upcoming deadlines for other courses. Jeremy was okay with this and he suggested an intensive sprint after the PSI exam in a couple of weeks time. This will enable me to work full time on the project for a week or so before the Christmas break.

Jeremy was pleased to see that the application is now deployed. We discussed the Shibboleth integration. I explained to him that it is nearly done and that I just now need to configure Shibboleth with my Django application.

After my exam, Jeremy thinks I should work on an initial user evaluation. He has some postgraduate students that will be willing to help me out with this. I will start preparing for these evaluations within the next couple of weeks. This will mean I can fix issues arising from these studies before the Christmas break.

Jeremy suggested adding a search bar to the application - I like this idea and have added the feature to the backlog on Trello.

On the seminar history page, Jeremy suggested using some sort of prioritisation so that seminars which users are likely to have been to are suggested at the top. This will remove the need for users to scroll down the page constantly.

Finally, we agreed that next weeks meeting should be cancelled due to upcoming coursework deadlines. We will have our next meeting in 2 weeks time on 11th December.
