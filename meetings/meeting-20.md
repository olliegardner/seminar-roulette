# Meeting 20 - 26 Mar 2021

Today marked my last meeting with Jeremy. Since I have now finished my dissertation, he doesn't see the need to have another meet next week. I am on track to submit my dissertation well before the deadline. Jeremy suggested attaching my GitHub repository link in my submission somewhere as well as the zip of source code.

Jeremy has read through my abstract and conclusion chapters and has now given me feedback on both of these sections. His main comments on the conclusion chapter were:

- Are Pegasus and Shibboleth the same technology underneath?
- Try to finish upbeat at end of conclusion

Jeremy suggested that next week I implement some frontend unit tests so that I don't have to justify why I didn't implement them. He suggested looking into Selenium for this.
