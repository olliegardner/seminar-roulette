# Meeting 5 - 30 Oct 2020

The meeting began with me showing Jeremy the progress which I had made since last time. He thought that the roulette wheel was extremely fun! He suggested changing the rating to 1-5 instead of 1-10. He also thought that the rating could potentially be stars instead of numbers. This rating could then be used within a recommender system such as collaborative filtering. I will research different types of recommender systems and implement one for next time.

We discussed implementing a dropdown above the roulette wheel which will allow for users to find seminars which are happening in an hour, today, tomorrow, this week, etc. We both thought that this would be an extremely beneficial feature for the end user.

Jeremy was wondering if the system should have the university branding on it somewhere. I said that since we have the Shibboleth login then this is probabaly not needed at the moment. This is something that we will monitor and get feedback on. I need to work out the navigation flow of the website e.g. how does a user navgiate to their seminar history.

Jeremy would like to see a feature implemented where he can find seminars which provide food. Perhaps a _I'm Feeling Hungry_ button could be implenented. Seminars which provide food could also have a symbol to represent this too.
