# Meeting 18 - 12 Mar 2021

We started the meet by going through my implementation chapter that I sent Jeremy this week. Feedback was generally positive, but Jeremy thinks that I could explain some of my libraries and frameworks in more depth. He said that I shouldn't be assuming that the reader knows anything about my chosen technologies. Jeremy thought that I could cut down my software engineering practices section slightly as it won't get me many marks - it is assumed that these practices will be followed. I should also mention agile in it somewhere (agile is the philosophy, kanban is the implementation). In the performance regressions section, I should mention that advanced calculations could be performed on another thread e.g. running a batch job nightly to calculate user's similarities scores.

Jeremy said that to get an excellent grade on the dissertation I need to ensure that I show that I am a well-rounded computer scientist. For example, mention computing concepts and design patterns somewhere. The similarity algorithm has N users and M seminars so has a O(nm)^2 time complexity.

Finally, we talked about the presentation. Jeremy said that I shouldn't spent too much time on it as it is only worth 5%. He suggested that in the presentation I follow the same structure of my dissertation and give a rough outline of each chapter.
