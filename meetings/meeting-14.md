# Meeting 14 - 5 Feb 2021

The meeting commenced with Jeremy and I reviewing chapter 1 of my dissertation which I sent him last week. He gave me some great feedback on what I had written so far. However, Jeremy did say that sometimes it sounded like I was writing a business case instead of a report. He said that I should watch my language at points. I will make these changes over the weekend. We agreed that I will start on chapter 3 of the dissertation next and send him over a draft next week at some point.

Next, we dived deeper into chapter 3 and what involves. Within this chapter, I will discuss my project requirements. Jeremy stated that it was important to mention how I gathered these requirements. In my case, this was through existing systems, speaking to himself, conversations with other stakeholders and through an initial user survey. Following this, we discussed what I should include in the requirements chapter:

1. How requirements were gathered.
2. List both functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Prioritise requirements.
4. User stories (high level inspiration).
5. Group requirements by different components of the system e.g. database, frontend, backend or just group in any logical way.
6. Ensure that ALL requirements are numbered and labelled.

We then discussed the importance of error bars on graphs. Jeremy stated that it was only necessary to include error bars when I was graphing averages. This might well be the case when I start creating visualisations for my evaluation results.

For next meet, we agreed that I would continue to get more people to complete my evaluation for me and write the requirements chapter of my dissertation.
