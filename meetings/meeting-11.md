# Meeting 11 - 15 Jan 2021

This meeting marked the first meeting of the new semester. Jeremy and I began by discussing the think aloud evaluations which I conducted at the end of the last semester. Jeremy has reviewed the data and is sad to see that participants didn't like the roulette wheel.

I then went on to give Jeremy a demonstration of the application, showcasing the features which I worked on over the Christmas break. Jeremy was a big fan of all the new features, including the add to calendar button. He mentioned that it would be nice if the calendar invite dealt with timezones and this is something which might be worth testing.

I asked Jeremy when he thought I should stop developing features. He said that he would recommend working on development for 2 more weeks, then spend 2 weeks on evaluation and then do 1 final week of development where I'll make final tweaks.

For my evaluation, Jeremy is going to ask IT services if my howard.dcs VM can be opened up to the public for a small amount of time. On top of this, Jeremy said I should start thinking about what I want to find out from my evaluations e.g. usability, effectiveness. I could measure this by setting the participant a task to do on the application or test how long people spend on the website.

I asked Jeremy about the common pitfalls of the dissertation. He said that not leaving enough time to write it is a common problem. He recommended leaving myself plenty of time to write it.
