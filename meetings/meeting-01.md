# Meeting 1 - 2 Oct 2020

For the first meeting, Jeremy wanted to meet all of his project supervisees in a group setting. This was because most of the information he gave to us was generic.

Scott Wilson, a 5th year student, joined us to give us some advice and tips which he wish he had known when beginning his project last year. His tips were:

- He felt that sometimes he was swept away by the implementation and programming instead of concentrating on the dissertation
- He encouraged us to work on the dissertation throughout the project and not leave it until the last minute
- It is important to get the chapter headings for the dissertation sorted first as this will allow you to easily plan what you are going to write

As a group, we then discussed the scope of each project with Jeremy. Jeremy stated that it was important to make sure Seminar Roulette can be scaled up and work with academics across the whole campus.

For the next meeting, I should think about my end users and actors. I should also do some background reading/research into different event organisation systems which exist. As well as this, I should look into https://samoa.dcs.gla.ac.uk/ which is the current system which the University uses for finding seminars.

Jeremy will send out a Doodle Poll to organise individual time slots starting from next week.
