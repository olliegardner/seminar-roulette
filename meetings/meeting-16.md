# Meeting 16 - 26 Feb 2021

This was our first meeting for 2 weeks now due to the reading week last week. We started by talking about the progress that I've made on my dissertation so far. Jeremy has now read my background chapter and has made a few suggestions on things that I should change:

- Add another section showing how another university handle seminar management e.g. https://talks.cam.ac.uk/.
- Redraw collaborative filtering process figure as it was unclear at first glance.
- Mention data types in the figure which shows the pseudocode for the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm.

Next, we discussed which chapter I should write next. We both agreed that I should start the design chapter next. Jeremy noted that the design and implementation chapters will be the largest in terms of page length. His tips for the design chapter were as follows:

- Describe the high-level design of the project.
- Don't mention specific frameworks.
- Include system architecture diagrams e.g. UML diagram, object orientated class hierarchy, data source and data sync.
- Include database schema OR ER diagram - strip ID fields as they are not imperative (mention in caption implicit fields that been removed).
- Mention algorithms in design - explain matrix decomposition

I asked Jeremy whether he thought that I should mention the Samoa Events and Eventbrite API in the design chapter. However, he informed me that I should include this in the implementation chapter.

Finally, Jeremy recommended that I get other people to read my dissertation in order to get a fresh set eyes on it and to notice mistakes which I may have missed.
