# Meeting 19 - 19 Mar 2021

This week, we went over the evaluation chapter of my dissertation that I sent Jeremy yesterday. He has now given me feedback for the evaluation, and I will act on it next week. The points that he raised were:

- Write some more unit tests for the `managers.py` file to increase the code coverage for that file.
- Think aloud evaluation - stress when it was in terms of project (midway point of project, got early prototype but wanted to prioritise implementation decisions for 2nd semester)
- Mention who participated in my final user evaluation - peers, members of the university research community, tech savvy people
- Describe the 2 end points of the Likert scale - strongly agree = 1 and strongly disagree = 7
- Add a section about security and privacy of user data (evaluate GDP) e.g. don't require any cookies, all served over https

Jeremy suggested spending 1 more week writing my conclusion chapter then 1 week polishing off my dissertation. Jeremy's top tips for the conclusion chapter were:

- Give a brief summary of the entire project
- Mention future work if spending another 6 months on the project
- Reflection (very personal, experiences of the project, greater insight into the workings of the University, learnt how to build UI for deployed software)
