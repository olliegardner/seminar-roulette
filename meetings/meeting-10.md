# Meeting 10 - 11 Dec 2020

The meeting started with me giving Jeremy a demonstration of the progress which I made over the last couple of weeks.

Jeremy said that he thinks I am close to having an initial prototype ready. He said that he thinks I should now start looking into making the recommender engine smarter. He suggested that I could do this by taking a seminar's description, parse the text and pluck the keywords from it. I could then remove the stop words and highlight the keywords using a word cloud or a similar representation.

If a user rates a reoccurring seminar, ask if they want to rate just this one or all future seminars in the same way.

A filter could be added to filter out seminars which have TBA/TBC in the title.

I said to Jeremy that I would like to carry out my first initial evaluation soon. I would like to do this using a think aloud evaluation. Jeremy has put me in touch with some of his PGT students as he said they will be willing to help me. Jeremy suggested that in my evaluation, I either give the user a task to complete or just let them roam about the system as they wish. Jeremy said that I should send him across my signed ethics form before completing these evaluations.
