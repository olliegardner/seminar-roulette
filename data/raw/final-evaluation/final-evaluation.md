The only thing I wonder about is whether you will be able to drive people to use the system. I wonder if an integration with Teams, email or Exchange Calendar (so recommendations actually appear in my calendar as tentative) would make this slicker.I really like the 'serves food' only feature - very cheeky! | Being able to filter my subject area etc would be useful for when using the system in 'seminar aggregator' mode rather than for recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | See comments above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Clean straightforward easy                                                                                                                                                       |

You could do this by merging it with the calendar functionality, where you mark a series of seminars that are of interest, along with their "interest rating" before downloading a single calendar file that contains all events. This would make the calendar feature more useful as well, as I wouldn't have to import individual events. 3) Integrate the search results page using the same tabbed layout for the other sections ( recommendations, upcoming .... , search results) so that users have an easily recognizable way of going back to the main functionality. Regular users may not know that it is a standard convention to click the "Seminar Roulette" logo in the upper-left corner to go back to to the main page. 4) Make sure that rating is done with asynchronous calls that update the rating, rather than refreshing the page and removing the rated seminar from the list. 5) Some of the actions (pagination on upcoming seminars) is slow. You should introduce some view/template caching with a reasonable cache expiration ( could be up to an hour easily ) or even better, explicit cache invalidation only when required ( new seminars are added ) | See comment 2) in previous question about multiple events per / calendar download. Additionally you may want to have a "within system" view/management of that calendar before downloading - or to serve users that don't have a dedicated calendar client.                                                            | Very promising.
