# Think Aloud Evaluation - Participant 5

If the seminar is TBA or TBC, perhaps show an icon which hints at what the seminar is about. Maybe the icon could represent the department which is hosting the seminar.

Have the option to filter out TBA/TBC seminars or prioritise them to the bottom of the page.

Be able to enter your own interests and each seminar shows a % match - 70% match based on your interests.

Too many tabs at the top - reduce these.

Have the option to filter by department.

Search bar was not obvious at first - maybe change the colour slightly so that it stands out from the rest of the header. Search bar suggestions as you type would be a nice feature.

Likes how the UI is simple and easy to navigate with minimal mouse clicks.

Do not show the wordcloud if the seminar doesn't have a title or description.

Add seminar to calendar feature.

Would like to be able to use the application without signing in.

Serves food icon is not obvious that it can be clicked.

Online seminar icon not obvious - maybe just use text instead of an icon.

If a user hasn't rated any seminars, don't show any recommendations to them.

Discard not a good word to use, perhaps change this to "unattended".
