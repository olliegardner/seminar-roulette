# Think Aloud Evaluation - Participant 6

At first glance, the layout is complicated - should have a dropdown for selecting the time period.

Add a new tab at the top which shows all seminars - past and upcoming together.

Likes the roulette wheel but thinks that it might become annoying for some users.

Would like to have the option to switch to a list view.

Add a legend which indicates what all the icons mean.

Make the searchbar slightly wider so that it stands out more.

Random seminar button would be better somewhere at the top of the page and not in the bottom right hand corner.

Make sure the recommender system only recommends seminars which you haven't been to before.

Doesn't see the need to use the system without being logged in.

Integration with Microsoft Exchange would be a nice feature so that the application can recommend seminars which fit around your timetable.

Add some customisation options, such as, change the colour scheme.

Ability to add seminars to your calendar.

Send email reminders when seminars are coming up.

Filter by internal/external seminar e.g. internal if the speaker is from the University of Glasgow, external if they are from elsewhere.

On the left hand side, add a menu which contains filters.

Add a link to the speaker's website so that users can find out more about the person.

Add a map, perhaps a Google Map, which shows the location of the seminar.
