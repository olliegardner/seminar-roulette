# Think Aloud Evaluation - Participant 3

Immediate reaction on landing page:

- A subscribe button would be nice which emails you periodically.
- Too many tabs with empty information - don't show the tabs if no information.
- Classification system of seminar keywords. Tabs to filter out classifications.
- Word cloud is good - perhaps add keyword to seminar card.

Would be nice to a difficulty level for a seminar - ask seminar speaker ahead of time for prerequisites.

Display a map of the seminar location - how long would it take to walk to the location - influences decision whether to go to the seminar or not.

Data mine - recommend seminars to you based on like minded people - want to go to seminars which your peers go to.

Random seminar tab instead of floating action button which shows a list of random seminars.

Didn't understand what they should be rating seminars based on e.g. difficulty, content, etc?

A calendar view would be nice which shows seminars which the user is due to give.

Add a profile page where you can see information about yourself.

Published papers for seminars which a user can read beforehand. Work out from the text if the seminar speaker has a published paper - text processing.

Likes the idea of being able to use the application anonymously.

Minimise the seminar cards which don't have much information on them.

Option to switch between card and list view for seminars - list view only have seminar title on it.

Perhaps need to consider people with colour blindness or other disabilities.

Profile picture of the person hosting the seminar.
