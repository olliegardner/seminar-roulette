# Think Aloud Evaluation - Participant 4

Layout is a bit dense - reduce the number of columns.

Have a representative thumbnail for TBA seminars. Could also have an icon which represents the seminar group e.g. maths, chemistry, etc.

Colour code the dates depending on when they are occurring - this will allow users to see seminar dates easily at a glance.

Split the tabs - 2 semantic domains. Time in column on the left hand side - like a matrix to pick the time.

Search seminar box not clear at first glance - alter the colour and make it bigger.

Rename "for you" tab to "recommendations".

Add counter bubbles to the tabs to indicate the number of seminars in each tab.

Add the ability to undiscard a seminar.

Show seminars related to that seminar on a seminar's page.

Suggest seminars as you type in the search bar.

Wordcloud - click on a word and show all the seminars relating to that keyword.

Search bar - show most relevant search first.

Add to my calendar feature.

Random seminar button should be in the top left or right of the screen - noticed the button in the bottom right hand corner but didn't expect it to be there.

Didn't like the roulette wheel - became sick of it quite quickly.

Perhaps when a user clicks on a seminar, the card could expand instead of taking you to a new page. This will keep the user on the one page.

Would be good to have a small widget which gives the user a tutorial of the application.
