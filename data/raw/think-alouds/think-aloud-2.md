# Think Aloud Evaluation - Participant 2

Didn't understand what the aim of the application was when first greeted with the dashboard. Suggested implementing some sort of help page or some descriptive text to explain what's going on.

Found TBA/TBC seminars annoying and taking up a lot of space. Would like the option filter out TBA/TBC seminars.

Didn't understand what the "for you" tab was for. Suggested renaming it to "recommended". Within this tab, would like to see 2 different sections - 1 section for recommendations based on how you rate seminars and another section for seminars which relate to your interests.

At first, didn't understand what was meant by "discarding" a seminar. Thinks the "X" should be replaced with descriptive text. A question should be asked also - "did you attend this seminiar?".

Online seminar icon not clear.

Random seminar button not clear in the bottom right hand corner. Random seminar doesn't work as expected if on a seminar page.

Would like to see a list view of seminars instead of a grid view. Indifferent to having the ability to switch between list and grid.

Felt that the random seminar wheel span for too long. It became frustrating to use after multiple uses.
