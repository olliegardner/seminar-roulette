# Think Aloud Evaluation - Participant 1

First impression of the interface is that it looks nice. However, the grid structure is not easy on the eye - a list structure would be better.

An option to filter out TBA/TBC seminars would be a nice feature.

60% of the screen is taken up by things that aren't important. 1 seminar per row of items would allow for quicker accessibility.

Option to switch between list/grid view and ability to save this default in user profile.

Ability to filter by online/in person seminars.

Re-arrange the layout of the tabs at the top of the page. There are too many tabs. Put the filters at the top. Have the ability to filter by location, time and topic.

Would like to see a feature which shows which seminars people are viewing the most. What's hot? What are people clicking on?

Seminar page could be a pop up instead of its own individual page - people are time poor and want to bounce around the system.

Wants the ability to add tags so that the user can specify what sort of things they are interested in.

See most interesting words - word cloud for all seminars (global wordcloud).

The online icon is not explicit as to what it means - globe with mouse click or www icon would be clearer. Food icon should be a coffee cup as fast food icon is not relevant to seminars.

The date number on the seminar tile could be bigger - hard to read at first.

Didn't understand what the application was all about at first - would be good to add some blurb text somewhere to explain.

Didn't notice the random seminar button at first but suggested that the button could be moved to the top left or top right.

A feature where you could add the seminar to your calendar would be nice. Should be able to scrape this from Samoa and EventBrite easily.

A future improvement could be the ability to comment on seminars. This would add a community aspect to seminar roulette. Also nice to be able to click on a speaker's name and view seminars which they are presenting in past and future.

Don't lose sight of the core focus - recommending seminars to people which they are interested in.
