# Initial User Survey

Before the project commenced, an initial user survey was conducted with potential end users of the application. The survey was used to build a set of functional and non-functional requirements for the system. The survey was carried out using Google Forms and the questions/responses can be found below. All data was collected anonymously and in a way which complies with the university's ethics checklist.

## Questions

1. On a typical week, how many seminars do you attend at the university?
2. What is your main area of research?
3. Currently, we have 2 potential data sources for Seminar Roulette - Samoa (https://samoa.dcs.gla.ac.uk/events/) and EventBrite. Are there any other data sources which you are aware of that the University use for advertising seminars? If so, what are they?
4. We would like to connect your calendar so that the system can suggest seminars which fit around your schedule. Which calendar service(s) do you use for work?
5. I think that it is important for the system to take into account my preferences/interests so that it can suggest seminars which I like.
6. I would like there to be a feature which randomly suggests seminars to me.
7. Once relevant seminar(s) have been suggested to you, would you like to be able to add them to your respective calendar?
8. Once relevant seminar(s) have been suggested to you, would you like to be notified before they start by email or otherwise?
9. We endeavour to integrate the University's single sign-on system (Shibboleth) into the web application. Would you like to be able to use the system anonymously too?
10. Are you interested in attending seminars outwith your school/research area? For instance, would you be interested in attending Engineering seminars if you are a Computing Science academic?
11. Are there any additional features which you would like to see implemented into Seminar Roulette?

So I'd be cautious with that. Maybe you could have a Serindipityometer slider or something to set my preference for, at one end of scale, only meeting my exact preferences, and at the other end recommending any old randoms! |

| 6           | 1          | Computing Science    | The samoa system doesn't cover all events going on within the university, only feeds that have been specifically included in the system (the original idea was to encourage everyone to use it directly, but obviously people are reluctant to change something they have that works for them). Right now it imports events from several external sources: Maths&Stats, Psychology, Social Sciences, The Data Lab, SICSA among others. It'd be worth checking some of the other schools/departments to see if they advertise seminars in some easy-to-parse format. There's also a university events page at https://www.gla.ac.uk/events/listings/ (might be some overlap with samoa, I'm not sure) | Google Calendar                                       | Agree          | Agree          | Yes        | Yes        | Yes        | Yes         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
