This think aloud evaluation was conducted on 16th December 2020. Its aim was to gather feedback from potential users of the application in its current state. Using this feedback, changes will be made on the application which reflect the end user's wants and needs. The feedback will also steer the project in the right direction for the start of semester 2. All data was collected anonymously and in a way which complies with the university's ethics checklist.
