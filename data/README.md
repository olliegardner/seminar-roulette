# Data

Data gathered from user evaluations will be stored within this folder.

## Ethics

As this project involves human subjects, ethical permission had to be granted to carry out evaluations. All items related to ethics, such as the signed ethics checklist, are kept in `data/ethics`.

## Raw Data

Evaluation results, such as survey responses, can be found within `data/raw`. This is raw data which has **not** been modified in any way.

### Initial User Survey

Before the project commenced, an initial user survey was conducted with potential end users of the application. The survey was used to build a set of functional and non-functional requirements for the system. The survey was carried out using Google Forms. All data was collected anonymously and in a way which complies with the university's ethics checklist.

### Think Aloud Evaluation

A think aloud evaluation was conducted on 16th and 17th December 2020 over Zoom with 6 participants. Its aim was to gather feedback from potential users of the application in its current state. Using this feedback, changes will be made on the application which reflect the end user's wants and needs. The feedback will also steer the project in the right direction for the start of semester 2. All data was collected anonymously and in a way which complies with the university's ethics checklist.
