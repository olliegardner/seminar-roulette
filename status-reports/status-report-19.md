# Status Report 19 - 25 Mar 2021

This week, I wrote the conclusion chapter of my dissertation and also a short abstract. I have sent the conclusion and abstract to Jeremy for his feedback. This now means I have completed my dissertation, and this leaves me with 2 weeks before the deadline to perfect it and ensure that I am not missing anything in it. I haven't yet made the changes to my evaluation that Jeremy suggested as I have been concentrating on coursework this week, but I hope to do this next week.

This just leaves my presentation to create and record which I am hoping to do next week. I also want to improve some of my figures in my dissertation and I have plenty of time to do this before the deadline. I am going to check in my meeting tomorrow with Jeremy to see if he thinks I am missing anything major from my project and dissertation.
