# Status Report 10 - 14 Jan 2021

This status report will cover the work I have completed since the final meeting with my supervisor in December 2020. Since this meeting, I have conducted initial think aloud evaluations with my supervisor's PGT students. Their input has given me copious amounts of feedback to work with. I have collated their feedback and the raw data can be found within the `data` folder of this project.

Over the Christmas break, I started acting upon their feedback. This started with me changing the grid structure of the platform to a list. The evaluation participants felt that the grid structure was cluttered and often hard to read. Following this, I added pagination so that the seminars aren't all loaded in at once. The participants felt that it was important to be able to use the system anonymously, so I added this feature to the system. Currently, if a user isn't logged in, some of the features will be disabled for them.

Next, I added a button which allows a user to add a seminar to their calendar. This downloads a .ics file which a user can easily add to their icalendar. Lastly, I implemented a feature where a user can enter up to 5 personal interests. Using this data, seminars are recommended to users based on their interests.

Finally, I have started writing the dissertation. I have only written a few paragraphs so far but have started planning more.
