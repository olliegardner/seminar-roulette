# Status Report 14 - 11 Feb 2021

This week, I have continued conducting my final user evaluation with different participants. At the time of writing, 33 people have completed the questionnaire, but I think I will be able get a few more people to do it. I would like to bring my final evaluation to end early next week so that I can start collating the data and analysing it. I am hoping to create some nice-looking graphs from the data to include in my dissertation.

I noticed that there were a few small spelling errors on the system, so I have rectified these. Lots of people were noticing these mistakes during the evaluation.

I have continued with the writing of my dissertation. I managed to complete the requirements chapter this week and send it to Jeremy for him to have a look at when he gets a chance. I would like to start writing chapter 2 next week which will compare Seminar Roulette to pre-existing technologies. Chapter 2 will contain a literature review and will I seek guidance from Jeremy in our meet tomorrow on the best way to approach it.
