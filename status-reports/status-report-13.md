# Status Report 13 - 4 Feb 2021

At the start of the week, I froze the Seminar Roulette codebase in preparation for my user evaluation. Before this took place, I implemented a couple more features to make the platform more user friendly. This includes a help button and also a dark mode. On top of this, I fixed some bugs which appeared when using the web application on the howard.dcs VM.

Following the freezing of the codebase, I completed my evaluation questionnaire and sent it to Jeremy. I added an ethics section to it so that it complies with the school's ethics checklist. I have now started sending the evaluation survey out to various different people. At the time of writing, 12 people have completed it, but I am hoping that I will be able to get more. Jeremy has set me a target of getting 50 people to complete it. The feedback I have received so far has been mostly positive and it is great to know what other people think of Seminar Roulette.

Finally, I completed chapter 1 of my dissertation and sent it to Jeremy for him to have a look at. I am now starting to plan the next chapter of my dissertation. I am thinking that I am going to write chapter 3 next.
