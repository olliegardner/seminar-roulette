# Status Reports

Status reports written prior to every weekly supervisor meeting. These were submitted to the supervisor 24 hours prior to the meeting so that they could check up on progress since the last meet. This folder also contains the status report submitted at the end of semester one to summarise the work carried out prior to the Christmas holidays.
