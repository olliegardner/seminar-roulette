# Status Report 8

I have successfuly managed to deploy the application to the VM this week. On top of this, login via Shibboleth is now working too. These have been my main tasks this week. This means that the application will now be able to be accessed by people around the university. They will be able to access the system by navigating to howard.dcs.gla.ac.uk. Other than this, I have unfortunately not made much progress on the project. However, I have adapted the seminar history page so that are now fewer clicks when users are giving seminars a rating.

I have started looking into how users will be able to connect their calendars to the system but have not started the implementation of it yet. This is due to me having many outstanding deadlines for other courses. I hope to make more progress when we have the dedicated project week at the end of the semester.
