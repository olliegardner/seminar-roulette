# Status Report 18 - 18 Mar 2021

This week, I wrote the evaluation chapter of my dissertation. I also created some figures and graphs to go in it. I have now completed it and sent it to Jeremy for his feedback. This now just leaves the conclusion chapter to complete. I will have ample time to finish and perfect the dissertation before the deadline. I think my conclusion will be ~2 pages long which leaves me with a page leftover before I reach the 40 page limit. This will aid me when I am going over my dissertation as I will be able to add new sections if need be.

I have also started to think about what I am going to include in my final presentation that I will need to record in the coming weeks. I think I am going to cover the topics mentioned in my dissertation but give a very high-level overview of each.
