# Status Report 2

This week, I have built upon my research which I conducted last week. I developed a user survey and sent this round to some staff members which I know well. This survey was extremely beneficial as it has allowed me to create a set of functional and non-functional requirements. This has allowed me to build upon my understanding of the final product. Using the survey results, I am now aware of more data sources which I can use to track seminars which are happening around the university.

Last week, I created some basic wireframes and user stories. I have now updated these following on from my user survey. They are much better now I think and reflect upon Seminar Roulette's goals nicely. I have created a first version of my database schema. I would like to use PostgreSQL for this as it is a relational database. I also have experience of using it in prior projects. Using a relational database will allow me to easily track a user's interests and which seminars they have attended. I am currently looking into the option of using Redis to cache some of the API calls that I make to external data sources. I would like to talk to Jeremy about this in our next meeting to get his opinion on it.

I have setup my chosen technology stack (Django Rest Framework and React). These act as separate client and server applications using a JWT to interact with eachother. Currently, the applications don't do anything but it was nice to get these setup and ready for development to commence.

The school have kindly provided me with a VM. I am yet to set this up but I endeavour to do this over the weekend. I need to conduct some research into whether to use Apache or Nginx. I have experience of using both technologies but I wonder which one will be best suited to Seminar Roulette. I have contacted John Watt and asked him if he can assist me with setting up Shibboleth on my VM. He is currently on annual leave but hopefully I will hear back from him soon.
