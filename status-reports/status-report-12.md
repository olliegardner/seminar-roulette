# Status Report 12 - 28 Jan 2021

I started this week by fixing some bugs which arose from the think aloud evaluations and whilst testing out the application with Jeremy. All known bugs should now be fixed in preparation for carrying out my final user evaluation. There are still a couple of things I would like to fix before carrying out my evaluation, but I will do these this weekend. This includes ensuring that the application is responsive on mobile.

Following the fixing of bugs, I have created a first draft of my final user evaluation survey which I will share with Jeremy in our next meet. My aim is to make any changes to it over the weekend which Jeremy might suggest. This will mean that next week, I will be able to start carrying out my evaluation. However, this might only be possible if I am able to get the howard.dcs VM opened up to the public for a period of time.

I have also written a bit more of my dissertation this week. I think I am nearly close to finishing chapter 1 and hope to have this completed soon.
