# Status Report 3

This week, I first started by setting up the howard.dcs VM. This caused me a lot of hassle as it is something that I have little experience in doing. I managed to successfully set up Django, React and an Apache web server. I still need to set up the PostgreSQL database on VM. However, this is all set up correctly on my local machine. After this, I contacted John Watt who explained to me how to install Shibboleth onto my VM. This was fairly easy to do and didn't take long. John has been unable to configure Shibboleth on the VM yet as I need to SSL enable the VM. I have contacted support to ask if port 80 can be opened up to the internet so that my Let's Encrypt certificate can be validated.

Following this, I changed the way Django and React were set up in my repository. They used to act as separate applications and use a JWT so that they could interact with eachother. After thinking about this, I didn't think this was the most optimal setup for Shibboleth. I could not work out how I would be able to pass the JWT from Shibboleth back to the application. Instead, I have now created a Django application and React acts as a _Django template_. This removes the need for a JWT.

Next, I started the development of Seminar Roulette. I started by testing out the Samoa Events API calls in Postman so that I could get to grips with it. After this, I wrote a script that pulls data from Samoa and populates the Seminar Roulette database. I envisage that this script will be run in a nightly cronjob in order to retrieve the latest data. I then created a _Random Seminar_ button which randomly chooses a seminar from the database. It is then displayed on the frontend in a very basic manner.

Finally, I did some research into different CSS frameworks for React which I could use within the project. I would like to use Material-UI within this project. This is because it is made by Google, open source and I love the material design principles. On top of this, I also have experience with it so there won't be a steep learning curve for me.
