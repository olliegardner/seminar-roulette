# Status Report 11 - 21 Jan 2021

I started this week by creating a list of tasks I wish to complete before the development stage of the project comes to an end. Following this, I began working through the lists of tasks. First, I reduced the number of tabs at the top of the page as participants in my think aloud evaluation said that there were too many. Following this, I added the ability to sort and filter seminars to a user's requirements. For instance, you can sort the seminars in alphabetical order or filter them by only showing seminars which serve food. Within each tab, the number and types of filters change so that it makes sense for that specific tab.

I have also written more unit tests. Previously, I had a very small set of unit tests which were not testing the application in its entirety. I have now added lots more unit tests and have started testing my code coverage using the coverage Python package. I am aiming to have as high test coverage as possible to ensure that I don't push any broken code to production.

I am still working on chapter 1 of my dissertation, I hope to have this chapter finished over the weekend.
