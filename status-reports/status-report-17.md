# Status Report 17 - 11 Mar 2021

This week, I wrote the implementation chapter of my dissertation. I have now completed it and sent it to Jeremy for his feedback. I think the implementation chapter is a good length but would like Jeremy's opinion on it.

Next, I am going to start writing the evaluation chapter. I am hoping to start thinking about the sort of graphs I could include over the weekend. So far, these are the things that I think would be good to include in the evaluation chapter:

- Code coverage
- Correlations between data
- Trend analysis between evaluation questions
- Open ended questions - manually analyse and put responses into a "bucket" and prioritise for future work
- Open ended questions - sentiment analysis to see if feedback is generally positive or negative

I also finished writing the README for the project and also wrote a user guide that allows somebody else to install and run Seminar Roulette onto their own machine.
