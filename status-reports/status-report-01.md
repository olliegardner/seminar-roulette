# Status Report 1 - 8 Oct 2020

This week I started researching into different seminar data sources. So far, I have looked at Samoa (https://samoa.dcs.gla.ac.uk/events/) and EventBrite. I could not find any other data sources which the University seem to use for seminars. I would like to dicsuss this in the next meeting. I have contacted the developer of Samoa in order to ask how to connect to the API - he answered my query swiftly.

I have setup a GitHub repository and started to populate it. Do I need to add Jeremy to it? If so, what is his GitHub username?

I decided on my technology stack after conducting some research into various technologies available. I would like to use Django Rest Framework for the backend and React for the frontend as I have experience in using both of these technologies.

I have emailed SoCS support to ask if they can provide me with a Linux VM for the duration of the project. This will be essential for user authentication to work with Shibboleth. If a user is not authenticated, should they be able to still use the system but just anonymously?

I have created some basic wireframes for the system which show how the system will look. Also, I have written up some use cases for different users of the system e.g. staff and students. I wonder how Jeremy envisages the system to look or is this mostly up to myself?

I have downloaded Zotero which I will be using as my reference manager throughout the project.
