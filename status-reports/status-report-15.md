# Status Report 15 - 25 Feb 2021

Since our last meet 2 weeks ago, I have now finished my final user evaluation and collated all of the data. The data can be found in the `data` folder of the repository in both markdown and csv formats. Following this, I cleaned up some of my code and documented it in places where I thought it was missing some comments. I am still yet to write a readme or manual, but I hope to do this soon.

In terms of my dissertation, I have now finished the first 3 chapters. I am yet to act on the feedback which Jeremy gave me for chapter 2, but I hope to discuss this in our weekly meet tomorrow. He also gave me some tips for chapter 3, and I will need to adapt my requirements chapter accordingly. I am hoping to do both of these things over the weekend. In our meet tomorrow, I am going to seek some advice on the design chapter and see what Jeremy thinks I should be including in it.
