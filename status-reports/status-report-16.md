# Status Report 16 - 4 Mar 2021

This week, I have written the design chapter of my dissertation and sent it to Jeremy to get his feedback on it. This means I am now around halfway through the writing of my dissertation. I think my design chapter might be slightly on the short side, but I will be able to gauge this once I have written the implementation, evaluation and conclusion chapters. I am planning on starting to write my implementation chapter this weekend. I will seek guidance and top tips from Jeremy in our weekly meet tomorrow.

I have also created a README and user manual for the project. These are still a work and progress; I will probably add more detail to them as the project continues but it is good to have them there in the meantime.

I have a couple of questions that I am going to ask Jeremy in our meet tomorrow:

1. In background chapter, Jeremy asked me to include the URL of Samoa Events. Should I be putting this URL directly into the text or citing it?
2. When I am using numbers in my writing, should I use the numeric digits or the actual word? For example, "In this section, I will evaluate **two** e-commerce companies" OR "In this section, I will evaluate **2** e-commerce companies".
