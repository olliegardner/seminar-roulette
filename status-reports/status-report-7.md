# Status Report 7

This week, I have successfully managed to get a stream of data from EventBrite. I did this by using the EventBrite python API. I also considered web scraping EventBrite to retrieve the data but thought using the API would be easier and more logical. This means that Seminar Roulette now has a data stream from both Samoa and EventBrite.

Following the implementation of EventBrite, I created a dashboard where the user can see seminars at a glance. I have based this dashboard off the EventBrite dashboard. On the dashboard, you are able to see seminars sorted by different categories e.g. for you, today, tomorrow, etc.

I have also been working on getting the application deployed. I am close to getting it deployed but due to my inexperience with Centos, this has been a bit of an issue. The main issue I am having right now is enabling HTTPS via a self-signed certificate. Once I have resolved this issue, Shibboleth will also work.

Unfortunately, I completed less work than I would have liked to this week due to coursework. I am hoping to complete more work this weekend.
